    "The `pymssa` package implements Multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis in python. As of the time of this writing, I am not aware of any other implementation in python of *multivariate* SSA, though there are packages and implementations of univariate SSA. R on the other hand has the extremely comprehensive `Rssa` package for performing MSSA and its variants. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is definitely not as comprehensive as the `Rssa` package (which I believe is maintained by the creator of SSA), but it implements the fundamental components of MSSA. As of the time of this writing, the `MSSA` class features:\n",
    "- Uni- or Multi-variate decomposition of timeseries using Singular Spectrum Analysis\n",
    "- Automated options for selection of number of components:\n",
    "    - Variance explained thresholding\n",
    "    - Parallel analysis\n",
    "    - Singular Value Hard Thresholding\n",
    "- Calculation of the w-correlation matrix of component correlations.\n",
    "- Easy interface to assign and retrieve component groupings.\n",
    "- Easy accesss via attributes to:\n",
    "    - MSSA component matrix (or \"reconstructions\")\n",
    "    - Left singular vectors and singular values\n",
    "    - Explained variance scores and percent variance explained for components\n",
    "    - Per-timeseries component rankings by variance explained/reconstruction error.\n",
    "- Recurrent forecasting function. You specify timepoints out and optionally which timeseries and with which components to forecast with.\n",

    "## `pymssa` Uses `numba`-optimized Functions *(where possible)*\n",
    "\n",
    "While the `MSSA` class provides the main interface to the MSSA algorithm and tools, you will notice if you look through the code that the majority of the actual functions and math are imported from the `optimized` submodule. MSSA can be pretty slow and memory intensive, especially if you are dealing with large timeseries data. Where possible, I've converted the operations to `numba`-compiled functions that significantly speed up the algorithm. I've also tried to organize the loops, initializations, and intermediary steps in such a way that will minimize the memory required.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a large enough dataset you will still run into problems, particularly for the SVD steps and reconstruction of components steps, despite the optimizations. At a certain point I'm not sure if there are ways around this or if you just need a bigger computer. I am not a code optimization expert, so any contributions that help with this are more than welcome! See the **Contributing** section for more ideas if you're interested in adding to this package.\n",

    "## A Brief Note on the Math and Algorithms in MSSA\n",

    "I've chosen not to cover the math behind MSSA in this demo. There are many resources online and I would prefer this user guide to focus on the usage and implementation of MSSA in this package. However, for those in need of a reference there are two resources in particular that I think are very informative:\n",
    "- For an overview of the math and walkthrough of the code behind singular spectrum analysis I highly recommend this blog post by Jordan D'Arcy: [Introducing SSA for Time Series Decomposition](https://www.kaggle.com/jdarcy/introducing-ssa-for-time-series-decomposition). It is probably the best walkthrough of SSA that I have seen so far. It is for univariate SSA rather than multivariate SSA, but the concepts and math are essentially the same for both. \n",
    "- For the multivariate case, a fairly detailed overview of the math, trajectory matrix construction, and forecasting algorithm can be found in this paper available on Researchgate: [Multivariate singular spectrum analysis: A general view and new vector forecasting approach](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263870252_Multivariate_singular_spectrum_analysis_A_general_view_and_new_vector_forecasting_approach). The implementation here corresponds to the vertical formulation of MSSA (V-MSSA), which the authors in that paper argue is superior in performance to the horizontal forumlation. The forecasting in this package follows the recurrent forecasting formula for VMSSA. I would like to eventually have the vector forecasting method implemented as well, but have not coded it yet. See the **Contributing** section for this and more ideas if you'd like to add it."

Due to the fact that SVD is performed on trajectory matrices and then the reconstruction is done by converting the reconstructed trajectory matrices (elementary matrices) back into timeseries vectors via diagonal averaging, the reconstructed timeseries are not guaranteed to be orthogonal. There is a good chance that some timeseries components are highly correlated and should be \"grouped\" together (via adding together).\n",
